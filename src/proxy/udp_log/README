udp_log is a LOG server that sends client log messages as UDP
packets to a destination IP and port.

This component implements the standard notion of session policies.
The policy specifies the destination IP, UDP port and MAC address
as shown in the following example that shows the default values.

! <start name="udp_log">
!    <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!    <provides> <service name="LOG"/> </provides>
!    <config src_ip="0.0.0.0" verbose="no">
!      <default_policy ip="0.0.0.0" mac="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff" port="9" />
!    </config>
! </start>

The component also gets its source IP address from the config ROM.
The verbose mode acts as a pass-through mode of the LOG messages to the 
component's LOG session.

The UDP packets can be received with netcat or with log_udp.
